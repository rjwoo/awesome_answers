class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  # has_secure_password will give us functionalities needed for user authentication:
  # 1 - It will add attribute accessors: password, password_confirmation
  # 2 - It will add a validation for password presence and length of password (4..72)
  # 3 - If password_confirmation is set, it will validate that it's the same as password
  # 4 - It will add handy methods for us to automatically hash the password to the password_digest field and compare a given password
